# 1.) Set up your Azure Account and Installations 
Have an Azure account with an active subscription.

* NSBE Student - [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) | $100 in Azure for 12 months with free tier of services - no credit card required with academic verification

* NSBE Professionals - [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI-drA7Iqp6wIVEPDACh0gswLpEAAYASAAEgK9Q_D_BwE:G:s&OCID=AID2100131_SEM_EAIaIQobChMI-drA7Iqp6wIVEPDACh0gswLpEAAYASAAEgK9Q_D_BwE:G:s&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-drA7Iqp6wIVEPDACh0gswLpEAAYASAAEgK9Q_D_BwE)Â | $200 in Azure for one month with free tier of services - requires a credit card and probably the best fit for faculty evaluating Azure for course instruction unless your organization has a grant or enterprise agreement.

You download both applications at the same time. 


## 1.a) Install Python 3.6 or Higher

Install [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
** Check the box that states to set download path. 


## 1.b) Install Azure CLI 2.21.0 

Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 2.0.80 or higher, with which you run commands in any shell to provision and configure Azure resources.



# 2.) Now we're rolling ...
Once you have your applications installed we need to verify the versions.

Open a terminal/cmd window and check your Python version is 3.6 or higher:

CMD: 
```
py -3 --version
```
BASH:
```
python3 --version
```


Check that your Azure CLI version is 2.0.80 or higher:

```
az --version
```

Then sign in to Azure through the CLI:

```
az login
```

This command opens a browser to gather your credentials. When the command finishes, it shows JSON output containing information about your subscriptions.

Once signed in, you can run Azure commands with the Azure CLI to work with resources in your subscription.



# 3.) Download or Git Clone this Repository 
## 3.a) Downlaod the Code directly from GitHub


![github download](/code_download.png)
1. Code - Download
2. Unzip Locally from Downloads
3. Naviagte to the folder path of the download with Command Prompt "use cd". 

## 3.b) Using Git 
Use command prompt to create a new directoy for your project and navigate: 

```
cd Desktop
mkdir nsbe46_python
cd nsbe46_python
git clone https://github.com/kfolkes/nsbe46
cd nsbe46
```

The sample code contains an application.py file, which tells App Service that the code contains a Flask app.


# 4.)  Let's get "thangz" running (locally)
In the same command prompt terminal. 

First create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

CMD: 
```
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
BASH:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then set the FLASK_APP environment variable to the app's entry module and run the Flask development server:

CMD: 
```
SET FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run

```
BASH: 
```
export FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run

```

Open a web browser, and go to the sample app at http://localhost:5000/. The app displays the message Hello World!.

In your terminal window, press Ctrl+C to exit the Flask development server.


# 5.)  Now it's time to deploy 
```
az webapp up --sku F1 -n <app-name>

```
- If the az command is not recognized, be sure you have the Azure CLI installed as described in Set up your initial environment.

- Replace <app_name> with a name that's unique across all of Azure (valid characters are a-z, 0-9, and -). A good pattern is to use a combination of your company name and an app identifier.

- The --sku F1 argument creates the web app on the Free pricing tier. Omit this argument to use a faster premium tier, which incurs an hourly cost.

 * The command may take a few minutes to complete. While running, it provides messages about creating the resource group, the App Service plan and hosting app, configuring logging, then performing ZIP deployment. It then gives the message, "You can launch the app at http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net", which is the app's URL on Azure.
  
![CMD](/deployaz.png)


# 6.)  Browse to the app
Browse to the deployed application in your web browser at the URL http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net.
The Python sample code is running a Linux container in App Service using a built-in image.

![depolyedApp](/success_to_az.png)

## You did it ! 

This is a minimal sample app that demonstrates how to run a Python Flask application on Azure App Service on Linux.

Congratulations! You've deployed your first Python app to App Service. You are so smart!

# 7.) Redeploying updates to your code (Extra Credit) 

In your favorite code editor (Notepad works too), open application.py and update the hello function as follows. This change adds a print statement to generate logging output that you work with in the next sectioni or you can change it to whatever you want. 


```
def hello():
    return "Wha Gwan NSBE!"

```
Save your changes and exit the editor.

Redeploy the app using the az webapp up command again:

```
az webapp up

```

This command uses values that are cached locally in the .azure/config file, including the app name, resource group, and App Service plan.
